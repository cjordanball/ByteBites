/*
Using the JavaScript language, have the function CharlietheDog(strArr) read the array of strings
stored in strArr which will be a 4x4 matrix of the characters 'C', 'H', 'F', 'O', where C
represents Charlie the dog, H represents its home, F represents dog food, and O represents an
empty space in the grid. Your goal is to figure out the least amount of moves required to get
Charlie to grab each piece of food in the grid by moving up, down, left, or right, and then make
it home right after. Charlie cannot move onto the home before all pieces of food have been
collected. For example: if strArr is ["FOOF", "OCOO", "OOOH", "FOOO"], the least amount of steps
where the dog can reach each piece of food, and then return home is 11 steps, so your program
should return the number 11. The grid will always contain between 1 and 8 pieces of food.
