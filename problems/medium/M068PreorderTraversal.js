/*
Have the function PreorderTraversal(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which
will represent a binary tree with integer values in a format similar to how a binary heap is
implemented with NULL nodes at any level represented with a #. Your goal is to return the
pre-order traversal of the tree with the elements separated by a space. For example: if strArr
is ["5", "2", "6", "1", "9", "#", "8", "#", "#", "#", "#", "4", "#"] then this tree looks like
the following tree:

				5
		2				6
	1		9				8
						4

For the input above, your program should return the string 5 2 1 9 6 8 4 because that is the
pre-order traversal of the tree.
